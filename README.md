# Voice 🗣️ and RC 🕹️ Controlled Robot with Health Monitoring 🤖🏥

## Introduction

Welcome to the Voice and RC Controlled Robot with Health Monitoring repository! 🚀 This project combines the excitement of robotics with the functionality of health monitoring. The robot is designed to be controlled both through voice commands and a remote control (RC). Additionally, it has the capability to measure human temperature and heart rate pulse.

## Features

- **Voice Control:** 🗣️ Easily command the robot using voice instructions. It's equipped with a voice recognition system to interpret your commands and execute corresponding actions.

- **RC Control:** 🕹️ For more traditional control, you can use the provided remote control to navigate the robot in your desired direction.

- **Health Monitoring:** 🏥 The robot is equipped with sensors to measure human temperature and heart rate pulse. The data is displayed on a convenient LCD 16x2 screen.

## Components

- **Robot Base:** 🤖 The physical structure of the robot, equipped with L239D drive motors for movement.

- **Voice Recognition Module:** 🎤 A module capable of interpreting voice commands and converting them into executable actions for the robot.

- **Bluetooth Module (HC-05):** 📶 Enables wireless communication between the robot and the controller.

- **Remote Control (RC):** 🕹️ A dedicated remote control for manual navigation.

- **4 DC Motors:** 🛠️ Drives the movement of the robot.

- **Temperature Sensor:** 🌡️ Measures the temperature of the human body.

- **Heart Rate Pulse Sensor:** 💓 Monitors the user's heart rate.

- **LCD 16x2 Display:** 🖥️ Shows real-time data, including temperature and heart rate pulse.

## Usage

1. **Voice Control:**
   - Ensure the voice recognition module is powered on.
   - Speak clearly into the microphone with predefined commands to control the robot.

2. **RC Control:**
   - Use the provided remote control to navigate the robot.
   - Follow the instructions in the user manual for remote control commands.

3. **Health Monitoring:**
   - Place the temperature sensor and heart rate pulse sensor in contact with the user.
   - Real-time health data will be displayed on the LCD 16x2 screen.
